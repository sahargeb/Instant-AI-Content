## C++ Libraries & Frameworks for AI 

### What is Library?
Library is a collection of reusable functions used by computer programs meaning the resources which you can reuse which may include classes, subroutines, pre-compiled code, message templates, etc.

### What is Framework?
Framework is a piece of code that dictates how the project should be structured and run. It simply mandates the architecture of your project like defining the design parameters of an application so that you can focus on the specifics of the project.
