`Date`: 11 Sep 22 Session No. 01

`Subject`: Introduction | Linear Algebra

## Session content 
- Introduction to Equations.
- Linear Equations.
- System of Equations.
- Polynomials.
- Functions.

## Notes
- We use 4 fields of mathematics in AI and Data Science :
  - Algebra (Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations)
  - Statistics
  - Probability
  - Calculus
  
- ### Linear Equations
  - Is an equation that may be put in the form a1X1 + .... +anXn + b=0, where X1 ,..., Xn are the variables, and a1, ..., an are the coefficients, which are often real numbers. To yield a meaningful equation, the coefficients are required to not all be zero.
  - Eamples of Linear equations : 
    - graph in 2 dimentions :

    - graph in 3 dimentions :

  - We can represent a linear equation in more than 3 dimentions by using the `String Theory`.
   - about String Theory check [String Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IoOkp5bOds).
   
- ### Nonlinear Equations   
 - check [What Is a Non-Linear Equation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHangQlVe-E)     
 
- ### System of Equations :
```
3a + 4b + 5c = 0
2a - 3b + 7c = 8
5a - 13b + c = 11
```
  - To solve these equations, we find value for a ,b and c which solve the equations.
  - Equations may have no solution, exactly one solution or multible solutions. 
  - AI can generalize relations between data and optimize the solution easily.
  
- Nonlinear Algebra is more complicated than Linear Algebra.
- The greater the number of dimensions, the greater the Overfitting occures

## Tasks 
- How to convert Non linear Equations to Linear Form 
- What is PCA and how it works
- What are C++ Libraries / Frameworks for AI
